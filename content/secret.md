# Wait, how did you get here???

You really shouldn't be seeing this... It's a secret!

## Well...

Since youâ€™re here, I guess I can let you in on a little secret: the site uses **Markdown** (in case that wasn't already obvious ðŸ˜Ž).

### One Last Thing:

If you want to change the website name and its title (the one that appears in the browser tab), simply head over to:

```
themes/raspite/layouts/partials/head.html
```

There, replace `"Raspite Website"` with the name of your site.

For the favicon, just swap out the `favicon.ico` file in the `static` folder with your own. Easy as that!
